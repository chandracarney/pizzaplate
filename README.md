## Square pizza, circular plate solver

I have a perfectly square Pizza that has a side measuring 9 inches
and a perfectly circular plate with a diameter of 10 inches.
If I place the pizza on the plate, will any of the pizza hang over the plate?

I think this can be solved with Pythagorean theorem: a ** 2 + b ** 2 = c ** 2
we want to find the length of the square from diagonal corners (or the diagonal
of what would be 2 triangles). If this is the same length as the diameter of the
plate (10 inches), it will fit on the plate. Otherwise it will not fit.

So if we call a = 9 and b = 9, c must = 10 for the pizza to fit on the plate.
(9 ** 2) + (9 ** 2) = c ** 2
